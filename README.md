# Home Assistant Clash Controller

This fork is based on upstream v0.3.0. Version 0.3.1 preserves whitespace in
proxy group and node names when selecting a server. The version shown in the
local Home Assistant dashboard comes from the HACS update entity.

A Home Assistant integration for controlling an external Clash instance (now [Mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo)).

This is not a Clash implementation nor client, but an external controller designed as a Home Assistant integration to automate proxy control.

This is my very first Python / Home Assistant project, and I’m still learning. Please expect some instabilities and rough edges. Feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated. If you find this project useful, consider giving it a ⭐star to show your support!

## Compatibility

This integration works with all Clash cores and variants with Clash-compatible API.
Known working clients: Nikki, OpenClash, ShellClash and MerlinClash.

## Installation

Home Assistant Core must be `2026.8.0` or newer.

Choose your preferred installation method, and reboot Home Assistant afterward.

### Method 1: Through HACS

Add `https://github.com/newuser2k/ha-clash-controller` as a HACS custom
repository of type Integration, then open it in HACS.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=newuser2k&repository=ha-clash-controller&category=integration)

### Method 2: Manually

Download the repo and copy the folder `/custom_components/clash_controller` into your Home Assistant's `/config/custom_components` directory.

## Configuration

Configure `external-controller` and a non-empty `secret` first (for sing-box: `experimental.clash_api.external_controller` and `experimental.clash_api.secret`).

Use the core host's IP address or hostname and the controller port as the API address (e.g. `192.168.1.1:9090`), and `secret` as the token.

To add the integration, navigate to "Settings" > "Devices & services" > "Add integration" > "Clash Controller" or use the My button below. Then, follow the config flow.

Notes:

1. Restart Home Assistant and clear the browser cache if the integration is not listed.
2. Use a static IP or a stable domain. Address changes require reconfiguration.
3. Enable "Allow Unsafe SSL Certificates" for self-signed certificates within a trusted network.

## Usage

Availability of the following entities and services varies across cores.
Core capability is automatically detected at entry load, and unsupported entities will not be created.

### 1. Entities

- Proxy group and mode selectors
- Traffic, connection and memory sensors
- Provider counters and health-check buttons
- DNS and FakeIP cache flush buttons

### 2. Actions (Service Calls)

| Action                      | Description                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `reboot_core_service`       | Reboot the selected Clash core.                    |
| `filter_connection_service` | Find active connections and optionally close them. |
| `get_latency_service`       | Test the latency of a proxy group or node.         |
| `dns_query_service`         | Query a DNS record through the selected core.      |
| `get_rule_service`          | Find rules by type, payload or proxy.              |
| `api_call_service`          | Call any Clash-compatible API endpoint.            |

Example call of getting available proxies:

```yaml
action: clash_controller.api_call_service
data:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
  api_endpoint: proxies
  api_method: GET
response_variable: proxy_data
```

### 3. Streaming Services

Streaming service availability detection is disabled by default. To enable it, navigate to "Settings" > "Devices & services" > "Clash Controller" > "Options", and provide the proxy address in the format of `<address>:<port>` or `<username>:<password>@<address>:<port>`. Possible states include `available`, `limited`, `blocked`, `unknown`. Please note that only Netflix sensor is enabled by default.

Currently supported service(s): BBC iPlayer, DAZN, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, Prime Video, YouTube Premium.

Region information is included when available. `limited` status is only provided for Netflix to indicate Netflix Originals only access.

## Feedback

To report an issue, please include details about your Clash configuration such as client type, core type and core version, along with debug logs of this integration.

You can enable debug logging in the UI (if possible) or add the following to your Home Assistant configuration:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.clash_controller: debug
    clash_controller_api: debug
```
